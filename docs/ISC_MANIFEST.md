# The `isc.json` manifest

Every game submitted to ISC Steam must have an **`isc.json`** file at the root of its
Git repository. The platform clones the repo, reads this file, compiles the game and
packages it — no manual uploads needed.

## Minimal example

```json
{
  "iscVersion": 1,
  "title": "ISCtaker",
  "shortDescription": "A Scala port of Helltaker — push, dodge and puzzle your way to your demon companion.",
  "mainClass": "Main",
  "cover": "src/res/Banner.png"
}
```

## Full example

```json
{
  "iscVersion": 1,
  "title": "ISCtaker",
  "shortDescription": "A Scala port of Helltaker — grid puzzles, quirky demons, original music.",
  "description": "ISCtaker challenges players to navigate puzzle-like levels filled with moving obstacles, locked doors, and quirky demons. Push skeletons, collect keys, and reach your demon companion.\n\nMade for the ISC 1st-year course at HES-SO Valais.",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "authors": ["Louis Marello", "Sebastian Morsch"],
  "tags": ["puzzle", "2d", "keyboard"],
  "cover": "src/res/Banner.png",
  "screenshots": ["src/res/screenshot1.png", "src/res/screenshot level4.png"],
  "engine": { "name": "fungraphics", "version": "1.5.15" },
  "scalaVersion": "2.13",
  "mainClass": "Main",
  "sources": ["src"],
  "resources": ["src/res"],
  "controls": "Arrow keys to move · R reset · L hint · Esc close",
  "year": 2025
}
```

## Fields

| Field | Required | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `iscVersion` | yes | — | Manifest format version. Currently `1`. |
| `title` | yes | — | Display name in the store (max 80 chars). |
| `shortDescription` | yes | — | One-liner shown on store cards (max 200 chars). |
| `mainClass` | yes | — | Fully-qualified entry object (the one with `main` / `App`). |
| `description` | no | shortDescription | Long store-page text. Plain text, `\n\n` for paragraphs. |
| `version` | no | `1.0.0` | Game version; shown on the store page and in the package name. |
| `authors` | no | `[]` | Display names of the team. |
| `tags` | no | `[]` | Lowercase genre/feature tags (max 8) used for store filtering. |
| `cover` | no | — | Repo-relative path to the store banner (PNG/JPG, ~2:1 ratio ideal). |
| `screenshots` | no | `[]` | Repo-relative paths, max 6. |
| `engine.name` | no | `fungraphics` | Engine identifier. |
| `engine.version` | no | detected | FunGraphics version. If the repo contains `fungraphics-*.jar` it is detected automatically. |
| `scalaVersion` | no | `2.13` | Scala major version used to compile. |
| `javafx` | no | `false` | Set to `true` if the game uses JavaFX. The build merges the JavaFX jars (all platforms) into the package. |
| `javafxModules` | no | `["controls", "media"]` | JavaFX modules to bundle: `controls`, `media`, `swing`, `fxml`, `web` (`base` and `graphics` are always included). |
| `sources` | no | `["src"]` | Directories containing `.scala` sources. |
| `resources` | no | sources | Directories whose non-source files are bundled into the jar (sprites, audio, levels). Paths are kept **relative to the source root**, so `src/res/x.png` is loaded in-game as `/res/x.png`. |
| `controls` | no | — | Short line describing keyboard controls, shown on the store page. |
| `year` | no | current | Cohort/class year. |

## Build requirements

The build server compiles your sources with `scalac` against the FunGraphics jar,
then produces a runnable fat jar wrapped in a zip with `run.bat` / `run.sh` launchers.

For the build to succeed your repo must:

1. contain `isc.json` at the root,
2. compile with plain `scalac` (no sbt plugins, no IDE-only setup),
3. include its `fungraphics-*.jar` at the repo root **or** rely on the version vendored on the server,
4. load resources from the classpath or from paths relative to the source root (as FunGraphics examples do).

If a build fails, the full compiler log is visible on your publisher dashboard.

## Using JavaFX

Since Java 11, JavaFX is not bundled with Java — a plain `java -jar` fails with
*"JavaFX runtime components are missing"*. If your game uses JavaFX, set `"javafx": true`
and the platform bundles the JavaFX jars for Windows, macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon) and Linux
into your package.

One requirement: **your `mainClass` must not extend `javafx.application.Application`**
(the Java launcher refuses to start those without JavaFX modules installed). Use a plain
wrapper object instead, and point `mainClass` at it:

```scala
object Launcher {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit =
    javafx.application.Application.launch(classOf[MyGameApp], args: _*)
}
```
