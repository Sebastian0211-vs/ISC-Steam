# ISC Steam

A Steam-style library for the games made by ISC students at HES-SO Valais. Students submit
their Git repo, the platform clones it, reads an [`isc.json` manifest](docs/ISC_MANIFEST.md),
compiles the Scala sources against **FunGraphics**, and packages a runnable download
(fat jar + `run.bat`/`run.sh`) stored in MongoDB GridFS.

Built on the ISC app template: **Vite + React** client, **Express** API, **MongoDB** via
Mongoose — styled with the ISC visual identity from [ISC-HEI/isc-logos](https://github.com/ISC-HEI/isc-logos).

## Quick start

Requires **Node ≥ 20**, **git**, **Scala 2.13** (`scalac` on the PATH, needed to build games),
and (optionally) Docker for MongoDB.

```bash
npm install          # installs both workspaces
cp .env.example server/.env   # then edit JWT_SECRET and PUBLISHER_CODE
npm run db:up        # starts MongoDB in Docker (or use your own instance)
npm run dev          # runs API (:5174) and client (:5173) together
```

Open http://localhost:5173. **The first account you register becomes the admin.**
Everything works without MongoDB too — data routes just return 503 until it's up.

## How it works

**Roles**

- **Visitor** — anyone can register; can browse and download games.
- **Student (publisher)** — registers with the class code (`PUBLISHER_CODE` in `server/.env`);
  can submit repos, trigger rebuilds and read build logs on `/dashboard`.
- **Admin** — first registered account (or promoted later); moderates games
  (publish/feature), manages accounts on `/admin`.

**Publishing flow**

1. A student adds an [`isc.json`](docs/ISC_MANIFEST.md) at the root of their game repo
   ([example](docs/examples/isctaker.isc.json)) and submits the repo URL on `/dashboard`.
2. The build pipeline (`server/src/services/pipeline.js`) clones the repo, validates the
   manifest, imports cover/screenshots into GridFS, compiles all `.scala` sources with
   `scalac` against the FunGraphics jar (from the repo root, or vendored in `server/vendor/`),
   merges engine + `scala-library` into one runnable fat jar, and zips it with launcher
   scripts. Builds run one at a time; the full log is visible on the dashboard.
3. An admin reviews the game and publishes it — it appears in the store, downloadable by
   any signed-in account. Players just unzip and double-click `run.bat` / `run.sh`
   (only Java 11+ required).

## API overview

| Route | Access | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/auth/register` · `login` · `GET /me` | public / token | accounts (JWT) |
| `GET /api/games` · `/:slug` · `/:slug/media/:id` | public | store catalog + images |
| `GET /api/games/:slug/download` | any signed-in user | packaged zip (counts downloads) |
| `POST /api/games` · `/:slug/rebuild` · `PATCH/DELETE /:slug` | student/admin | publishing |
| `GET /api/admin/stats` · `users` · `games`, `PATCH users/:id` | admin | moderation |

## Scripts

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | client + server together with hot reload |
| `npm run dev:client` / `dev:server` | one side only |
| `npm run build` | production client build to `client/dist` |
| `npm run start` | run the API (serve `client/dist` behind your reverse proxy, or add `express.static`) |
| `npm run db:up` / `db:down` | local MongoDB via Docker |
