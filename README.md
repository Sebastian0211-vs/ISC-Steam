# ISC Steam

A Steam-style library for the games made by ISC students at HES-SO Valais. Students submit
their Git repo, the platform clones it, reads an [`isc.json` manifest](docs/ISC_MANIFEST.md)
when present (or infers minimal metadata from README/source files), compiles the Scala sources against **FunGraphics**, and packages a runnable download
(fat jar + `run.bat`/`run.sh`) stored in MongoDB GridFS.

Built on the ISC app template: **Vite + React** client, **Express** API, **MongoDB** via
Mongoose — styled with the ISC visual identity from [ISC-HEI/isc-logos](https://github.com/ISC-HEI/isc-logos).

## Quick start

Requires **Node ≥ 20**, **git**, **Scala 2.13** (`scalac` on the PATH, needed to build games),
and (optionally) Docker for MongoDB.

```bash
npm install          # installs both workspaces
cp .env.example server/.env   # then edit JWT_SECRET and PUBLISHER_CODE
npm run db:up        # starts MongoDB in Docker (or use your own instance)
npm run dev          # runs API (:5174) and client (:5173) together
```

For multiple Scala installations, the builder reads `scalaVersion` from `isc.json`
and looks for versioned variables such as `SCALAC_2_12`, `SCALA_2_12_HOME`,
and `SCALA_LIBRARY_JAR_2_12` in `server/.env` before falling back to PATH.
Repos can ship dependency jars directly, including gdx2d jars, or declare Maven
dependencies with sbt syntax in `build.sbt`/README; downloaded jars are cached in
`server/vendor/maven-cache`.
Admins can also provide fallback jars in `server/.env`, for example
`GAME_DEPENDENCY_JARS=server/vendor/gdx2d-demoDesktop-1.2.2.jar`.
Without `isc.json`, Scala is inferred from `build.sbt`, `.scala-version`, README,
or dependency jar names such as `*_2.13-...jar` before defaulting to `2.13`.

Open http://localhost:5173. **The first account you register becomes the admin.**
Everything works without MongoDB too — data routes just return 503 until it's up.

## How it works

**Roles**

- **Visitor** — anyone can register; can browse and download games.
- **Student (publisher)** — registers with the class code (`PUBLISHER_CODE` in `server/.env`);
  can submit repos, trigger rebuilds and read build logs on `/dashboard`.
- **Admin** — first registered account (or promoted later); moderates games
  (publish/feature), manages accounts on `/admin`.

**Publishing flow**

1. A student submits the repo URL on `/dashboard`. An [`isc.json`](docs/ISC_MANIFEST.md)
   at the repo root is recommended ([example](docs/examples/isctaker.isc.json)); without it,
   the build imports minimal metadata from `README*` and infers the Scala entry object.
2. The build pipeline (`server/src/services/pipeline.js`) clones the repo, validates the
   manifest or fallback metadata, imports cover/screenshots into GridFS, compiles all `.scala` sources with
   the requested Scala version against the FunGraphics jar (from the repo root, or vendored in `server/vendor/`),
   merges engine + `scala-library` into one runnable fat jar, and zips it with launcher
   scripts. Builds run one at a time; the full log is visible on the dashboard.
3. An admin reviews the game and publishes it — it appears in the store, downloadable by
   any signed-in account. Players just unzip and double-click `run.bat` / `run.sh`
   (only Java 11+ required).

## Deploying to a VPS (Ubuntu)

Requires Docker + Docker Compose on the VPS, and a domain with an A record
pointing at it (Caddy gets the HTTPS certificate automatically).

```bash
git clone <this repo> && cd ISC-Steam
cp deploy/.env.example deploy/.env      # set DOMAIN, JWT_SECRET, PUBLISHER_CODE
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file deploy/.env up -d --build
```

That's the whole deployment: the image bundles git, a JDK, Scala 2.13 and the
Windows JDK/JavaFX jmods so the build pipeline works in the container, the server
serves the built client on the same origin, and Caddy terminates HTTPS on ports
80/443. Update with
`git pull && docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file deploy/.env up -d --build`.

Note on game packages: on Windows servers the pipeline uses `jpackage` and games
launch via `Game.exe`; on Linux it cross-builds the same layout with `jlink`
(Windows Java runtime from Windows jmods) and games launch via `Game.bat` —
still no Java install needed for players.

## Desktop app (ISCSteam.exe)

`desktop/` is a thin Electron shell that loads the web app from your server —
no re-release needed when the site changes. Set your server URL once in
`desktop/package.json` under `iscsteam.url`.

```bash
cd desktop && npm install
ISCSTEAM_URL=http://localhost:5173 npm start   # test locally
npm run dist                                   # build dist/ISCSteam.exe (on Windows)
```

Releases are automated: pushing a tag like `v1.0.0` triggers
`.github/workflows/release-desktop.yml`, which builds `ISCSteam.exe` on a
Windows runner and attaches it to a GitHub Release.

```bash
git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0
```
